        <p>
          <b>Are you getting enough sleep? Are you getting quality sleep? </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          Most of us need around 8 hours of good-quality sleep a night to feel
          and perform at our best. Some will need more and some less. This
          can depend on factors such as age, health, and lifestyle.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are lots of factors that can cause poor sleep. Some of these
          include: stress and anxiety, drinking too much alcohol/caffeine, a
          poor sleeping environment, disturbance from children or partners,
          bad sleeping habits, or medical factors.

        </p>

        <p>
          The effects of a lack of sleep are well known and many of us will
          have experienced these at one time or another during our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these effects include feeling irritable and moody,
          difficulty concentrating and staying alert, and not being able to
          work properly. Aside from these, prolonged sleep deprivation can
          have consequences for your physical health as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          If any of this resonates with you, it's time to look at your sleep
          habits.

              <summary>Sharper Brain</summary>
              Without enough sleep, it's tough to focus and take in new
              information. Your brain also doesn't have enough time to
              properly store memories so you can pull them up later. Sleep lets
              your brain catch up so you're ready for what's next.
            </details>

            <details>
              <summary>Mood Boost</summary>
              Another thing that your brain does while you sleep is process
              your emotions. Your mind needs this time in order to recognize
              and react the right way. Refreshing slumber helps you hit the
              reset button on a bad day, improve your outlook on life, and be
              better prepared to meet challenges.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Healthier Heart</summary>
              While you sleep, your blood pressure goes down, giving your
              heart and blood vessels a bit of a rest. The less sleep you get,
              the longer your blood pressure stays up during a 24-hour cycle.
              High blood pressure can lead to heart disease, including stroke.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Steadier Blood Sugar</summary>
              During the deep, slow-wave part of your sleep cycle, the amount
              of glucose in your blood drops. Not enough time in this deepest
              stage means you don't get that break to allow a reset -- like
              leaving the volume turned up.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Germ Fighting</summary>
              Ongoing lack of sleep changes the way your immune cells work.
              They may not attack as quickly, and you could get sick more
              often. Good nightly rest can help you avoid that tired, worn-out
              feeling, as well as spending days in bed as your body tries to
              recover.
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Weight Control</summary>
              When you're well-rested, you're less hungry. Being
              sleep-deprived messes with the hormones in your brain -- leptin
              and ghrelin -- that control appetite.
